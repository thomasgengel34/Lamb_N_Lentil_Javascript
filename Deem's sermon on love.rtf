\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f0\fs22\lang9 We know in part, and someday we will truly know.  How do we know?  People talk about univocally, analogically, equivocally.  Now I know you are familiar with those, and I am not really going to discuss those.  What I am going to go with is the model that says we know truly, but impartially and imperfectly.  I'm taking this from 1 Corinthians 13, where Paul says "For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears."  I see Scripture as supporting the model I am describing - we really do know, if partly - and not supporting the ideas of univocality, analogism or equivocalism.  In the first case, we cannot know as God knows, as He knows all things at all times completely, perfectly, and thoroughly.  I can barely think about more than one thing at a time, and I doubt you can concentrate on two things at a time.  By its definition you cannot.  So univocality is out.  There are analogies God gives us in the Scriptures.  I will speak more about that later.  But equivocality - believing there is no connection between the truth and what we know -  is despair.  Back to analogism. God has given us analogies, parables if you will, by which we know Him. But if there is a parable, we must truly understand the objects in the parable in order to understand the parable.  Otherwise it would be nonsense : a zoon went down to lalala and he bebebed the thingamajigger - there is no meaning.  There must be real knowledge, although imperfect.  A man went down to Jericho and he fell among robbers: we may imperfectly know what a man is, and so on, but we know there is such a thing as a man. We have an idea.   We cannot say we do not understand the parable because we do not know what a man is. There is sufficient knowledge.\par
Mark Twain said he read the Bible to look for loopholes.  One is that people say we cannot understand these simple things.  It is too much. It is culturally appropriate.  Most, not all, but most of Jesus's parables are of the sort that it really does not matter what culture you are in, it is the same in all cultures.  A man went down to Jericho and fell amond robbers is completely clear whether you are an urban Chinese or a rural farmer, a coal miner in Uruguay or a Marine on the front lines.  It is clear enough that you are answerable for it.\par
I don't really know what love is, someone will say.  I know in part, but that is a mystery too deep for me.  So we escape what love is by claiming we do not know what it is.  Rubbish. We know enough.  We have had people love us, we have people who love us, we love some people, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.  There is enough love around us that we should know what love is.  We have experienced it, both as loving and as loved.  \par
And what is love?  Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. Some of you have seen that on the front lines.  Some of you are alive today because you saw a buddy throw himself on a grenade so you could live - literally laying down his life for his friends.  That is what love looks like.  It is not gushy sentiment, Valentine's Day cards and candy, kisses and hugs.  In case the ladies get mad at me, let me say that those can be expressions of love, but without the other, the deeper love, you would know it isn't love. If you get a box of candy from someone who does not love you, and you know he does not love you, it is cheap.  It does not help.   There must be an underlying love there in order for the candy to mean anything.  Am I okay now?  I'll send you a card if you are still mad at me. No.\par
Here is today's text: \f1\lang1032\u7952?\'ea\f0\lang1033  \tab\f1\lang1032\'ec\'dd\'f1\'ef\'f5\'f2\f0\lang1033  \f1\lang1032\'e3\u8048?\'f1\f0\lang1033  \f1\lang1032\'e3\'e9\'ed\'fe\'f3\'ea\'ef\'ec\'e5\'ed\f0\lang1033  from 1 Corinthians 13:9, the first half.  We will move into the second half next week.  Here we have \f1\lang1032\u7952?\'ea\f0\lang1033  - strangely, the Epper translation has "in" here - the Greek is more 'from, from out of' - before you get on me about criticizing the Epper translation, and I have done that before, and some have said things, understand that it is an older translation, and it is the original that is inspired, not the Epper translation. Usually it is a very good translation, but in preaching I must go to the Greek. I think you will agree with me there.  So we have "out of".  Next comes \f1\lang1032\'ec\'dd\'f1\'ef\'f5\'f2\f0\lang1033 , which is not an accusative plural as you might suppose, but is the genitive singular of  \f1\lang1032\'ec\'dd\'f1\'ef\'f2\f0\lang1033 , a neuter noun out to trick the unwary, because it does look like it should be masculine, what with the \f1\lang1032\'ef\'f2\f0\lang1033  ending in the nominative singular.  Before I get too grammatical let me add the nominative plural is \f1\lang1032\'ec\'dd\'f1\'e7\f0\lang1033 , which looks like it should be feminine singular.   There is a feminine word \f1\lang1032\'ec\'e5\'f1\u8055?\'f2\f0\lang1033  derived from the word here.  The only difference is something like we have between the words part and portion.  \par
So we have \f1\lang1032\u7952?\'ea\f0\lang1033  \f1\lang1032\'ec\'dd\'f1\'ef\'f5\'f2\f0\lang1033   - legitimately translated, despite me, as \i partially\i0 , or, as our Epper translation has it, "in part". The point being that you must look at words in context and not pull them out one by one.  And the same goes with verses, and with chapters, and the books of the Bible.  \f1\lang1032\'e3\'e9\'ed\'fe\'f3\'ea\'ef\'ec\'e5\'ed\f0\lang1033  is next.  We know.  Not e-pi-gi-nos-ko, thoroughly know, but just 'know'.  We know in part.  It would be ridiculous to thoroughly know in part, would it not?\par
So we know in part.  Well, what do we know.  We are talking in context of 'love'.  This is a sermon about 'love'.  We know in part.  So there are things about love that we know. And there are things about love that we do not know.  There are also things about love that we cannot possibly know.  And there are things we are wrong on about love.  \par
We know what love is from what the Bible says about love.  We know it in part, but we know it truly.  Love is patient, love is kind.  You can read the rest.  I plan to preach on all these qualities.  When it says love is patient, that does not mean patience is love.  Patience is an attribute of love, but that does not mean that is all that patience is.  This is something we know: love is patient.  We truly but partially, not comprehensively, know what love is, what 'is' is, what patient is.  We can grasp enough of it to grasp the truth.  You could say all the truth we know is analogical, that somehow 'love is patient' is only an analogy to what is true, but I think it is more forcefully true than to say it is an analogy for something else.  Love became incarnate and came down.  This is not some abstract thing off somewhere that we can never know.  This is something that has been seen, touched, smelt.  We have bread and wine in communion as a representation of truth that can be seen, touched, smelt and even tasted.  This is not a sermon on communion so let me stop there; the reality of the thing is the thing that matters, that is true, that we should be concerned about.  We should not be concerned with fables and myths of men but rather with the truth.  A hundred years ago someone would say that they did not believe something unless it was written in the Good Book. Today people have been known to say that has been debunked, or let them read a commentary on it and then they will know what it says.  The Scriptures truly point with truth to Truth, who is a human being, who is also God.  And He describes Himself as love. \par
What, if we do not love?  It is because we have not caught sight of that reflection in the mirror, that reflection of love.  And some will say it is not their fault.  God should have shown them love.  They are justified in not loving, they claim.  But we will see that such claims are false and bring down the judgement of God upon their miserable heads.  All men are sinners, and what that means is that God has already shown them, they are without excuse, they should have, in this case, loved, and they chose not to.  They knew better but they chose against wisdom, against goodness, against all that is right and holy.  God declares - present tense - declares His holiness and love in the creation, as it says in Romans 1, and He also declared it in the death and resurrection of His Son.  He also declares it to Christians via the Holy Spirit,  Whom He gives, Who continually whispers to the believer, if only he had ears to hear.  He does have such ears, though, and he must learn to use them to hear.  Old habits die hard, and the hardest is not listening to  God.  He will teach you.  He is, if you will, your personal Drill Instructor.  He has His eye on you and He is determined that you will not fail basic traning.  Does that mean Basic is easy? Far from it.  You will do the obstacle course until you get it right.  Until you can complete it on time.  You will shine your boots properly.  You will shoot your rifle correctly.  You will learn to hit the target.  You will not pass out of Basic until He deems you ready.\par
And so He trains us, not in shining boots, shooting rifles, or a physical obstacle course.  But He trains us in other ways.  One of those is in the way of love.  Some of you have not even been to God's recruiting station.  Some of you have entered Basic but have refused to move off those famous yellow footprints.  Some of you are in Basic, and some have graduated and moved on and through more advanced training.  Some of you are in combat, or have seen combat.  Some of you are wounded from combat.  The way of love is not something to take lightheartedly.  We know it partially.  It is putting yourself to death for the sake of the man on your right and the man on your left. Not living for yourself but for your Commander. Is that clear? Do you understand?\par
Do not hang back when it is time to love.  Do not say it is someone's else's turn, or never volunteer.  Some of you need to begin to love by apologizing.  Some of you never have, because you view it as weakness. Actually it is a sign of strength, because you have to be strong enough to humble yourself and admit you were wrong.  Some of you need to learn to be kind to your wife, or your husband, your boss, or the waitress at Butler's.  No, I don't have anyone in mind that I am singling out.  What do you get by not loving?  You get sent back in Basic when you need to be in combat.  That is no way to live in God's Corps, which is what you are in, a finer organization than the Marine Corps. \par
