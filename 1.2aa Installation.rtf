\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f0\fs22\lang9 "Thanks. I will indeed have another." Augustus Bishop Abernathy smiled at his second plate, brim-full of two massive pork chops with a side of potato salad.  Jake was expressionless; not ten minutes before he had pledged entire and complete, unreserved devotion to the good bishop, and now the basement of the church, never particularly large, was crowded with the bishop, his entourage, select members of the presbytery called to witness the pastoral installation, the local session, and serving women, teenagers who managed to gracefully slide through the mostly portly crowd with plates of steaming pork, pitchers of the dark Epper beer, their mothers dishing out the food and frowning in a way that could cut steel at any men whose eyes happened to follow the teenage girls too long, and then peach pie, cherry pie, apple pie was served, a seemingly unending cascade of food.  Afterwards they would collect the plates, platters of salad, mugs, pitchers, silverware, cloth napkins and the tables, chairs and floors would be scrubbed to the last electron while all was washed.\par
It was almost as crowded as the sanctuary had been.  Jake had removed the pews that Galloway had left, viewing them as a Catholic innovation, and it was packed, standing room only, and tight at that, with Jake and as many could cram onto the platform from the clergy up there, so it was hard to move and see things.  Some were out in the foyar, and the basement, aside from the kitchen area, was also full of laity listening to the proceedings and wondering if the floor was going to do more than creak.  "Epper built - they could fill it with elephants dancing and it still wouldn't fail," Bill Gains of Nicholls had told a young man, not an Epper, who had read some of Jake's writings and was curious about all this, this being his first actual contact with live Eppers, down in the basement.  Upstairs the bishop had to be careful not to move his arms too much as he prayed and preached and installed.\par
Thunder rumbled.  They would have had more laity, had they held this outside, but the storm had forced them inside, the ladies had been ill-informed as to the number of guests expected and a rather large pig had met its maker during the installation, one that had caught wind of its fate due to the speed of the whole thing, hauled out of a sheltered, warm strawlined stall into the cold rain, then been butchered and cooked while the service was being completed.  The door banged and a scarfed, wet young girl-head peeked in at the cooks, who looked expectantly: the pig, butchered, would not be ready, like some had said, but other pork had arrived, steaming in the rain, before being served out, and the laity had listened from the inside porch and the basement as their pastor was installed, listening to the pig screaming and being killed to the sound of Koine singing - they were in a hurry.  The comfortable, unchanging, eternal Epper liturgy, sung in Koine Greek, was run through, the long version, this being a high event, the long being merely the short with more material, and then the pastoral installation in the same language.  Laity could follow the first but the second contained quotes from Nazienzen, among others, that were rhetorical gems but hard to follow even in translation.  The pig had been silenced, though, before the installation itself, for which all were truly grateful.\par
"That man will stuff himself into the grave," Matushka Abernathy quietly told Betsy. They were sitting at a secondary table, the primary table being of course reserved for the celebrant and other pastors - there was a small amount of friction, hardly noticible, from a member of the local session who had been waved off by the good bishop with his explanation that he wanted a word with his pastors. The bishop sat convenient to the cooking and the surveying and could see the whole room, sitting central and presiding as if he were on a dias.  Betsy looked at Matushka's 300 plus pound husband.  Despite all the conversation, the clink of dishes, the thunder and sound of rain, and his age of somewhere in the high eighties, the bishop's voice out clearly. He had a fine, loud, clear voice, and it was indeed a pleasure to hear him sing in Koine.  \par
"Continence, my man, is a most excellent virtue.  Pastor Galloway, your predecessor, of happy memory, was most admirable in that regard," he was telling Jake and the others, loudly enough that the whole room could hear.'  To call it 'continence' was a stretch of amazing proportions. And 'of happy memory'.  Indeed.  The bishop rarely visited, but this visit would be remembered.  Those from Nicholls immediately removed every trace of emotion from their faces.   The amanuensis on his right, the only one not allowed to eat now, was writing down every word. "While not necessary, for example, if with purity of heart you can beget children without sin, something Augustine doubted, and I expect it is the fountainhead, if you will, of original sin. Do you not think that by 'the tongue' St. James was using an euphemism?  The whole body is set on fire more by that part that is not the tongue than by the tongue, is it not?  We have all known men who did not think with their brain but with the peccant part."  At this there were murmurs of agreement, "As pastors we withhold ourselves during a season of prayer. For us, of course, that is lifelong -"\par
"I would have loved to have had children," Matushka whispered to Betsy. "That man. I love him, but his ideas.  Don't let him get your husband to read Augustine 'On Continence'.\par
"Jake did read it.  He thought of all Augustine's errors, here they were consolidated. David had no interest in a woman except for the begetting of children? Indeed. I know Jake better than that. From him, men in general."\par
"Maybe he can straighten my Augustus out," and looking, it seemed Jake had said something, as the good bishop was looking astonished.  \par
"How is the bishop's retirement going?" one member of the presbytery, one table over, asked another. "Still looking into it," was the reply, and there were sighs.  A voluntary retirement was one thing, but this would be the nicest way of resolving matters. If Abernathy would not retire, there was precedent for his removal, but it was messy. \par
"Jake is all in favor of keeping in practice for the begetting of children," Betsy told Matushka.\par
"I envy you, girl. You shall be Matushka in more than name. How empty it is for me." \par
"Russians and Germans in one settlement? No, no, I am not at all in favor of these mixed settlements," the bishop was saying,"They have as much chance of success as did the Russians and Germans of being buddies in the middle of the war. Not that I think this Nicholls settlement - er, church - has any chance of success, and I wish you well, my son, I wish you well, but in my opinion the best thing to do would be to form one Russian settlement and another German. These cultures are hetereogenous - studies have shown that only homogenous settlements thrive.  One is happy only with one's own kind and assured that his interests will be met.  Here, one group should leave. Enough Epper settlements fail every year, and here you are with a church, of all things, not a proper settlement, hardly Epper at all. It is doomed.  Not that you do not have my full support and enthusiasm for what you are doing, but these resources and people would be better off elsewhere."\par
Jake said something that was not caught. Most of the people had stopped talking and had turned to hear their bishop.\par
"Further, a scholar like you does not belong among these Marines. Go back to academia! Leave these hayseeds alone. And these Marines? They think they are bullet proof. They are in no way true Eppers. I accepted you in this role because no one else wanted it, and here you are, but let me warn you, nothing good will come of it."\par
"Hayseeds," people looked at each other.  The only people in the room who were actually were from Nicholls were the elders of the session, retired Marine officers all, some of whom were now standing, bristling at the bishop. There was some conversation about them, as the room was so packed they would have difficulty reaching the bishop, and then what would they do? Punch a man in his late eighties? \par
"Excellence, my son," the bishop had moved on to another topic,"Must always be secondary to obedience.  While excellence is excellent, we call Him Lord, not Perfection, meaning we are to obey, and that perfectly, not be perfect, and then obey. I expect both obedience and excellence from you, my son.  Bear in mind you have promised me to confess any doubts - but I assure you, I am in favor of freedom of thought, academic freedom, that is to say, within the denominational guideliness our beloved Committee on Doctrinal Purity defends us with; thought must be trained.  Not that I am finding fault in you here, my beloved son; your works are praiseworthy and sublime. In short, do not call me, I will call you if I am concerned. As far as you are concerned, you are at liberty, subject of course to your vows.  But to continue, in our learned obedience we become perfect, which is our sanctification, and not the other way around, a Romish error."\par
"God bless the Reformation!" one of the other pastors finally got a word in. Some of them were aware of the danger present: the bishop was prone to a tedious prolixity at best on these occaisions and sometimes had threatened, sometimes forced promises out of them that at normal times would not happen, would not be remembered, and were sometimes awkward.  They had all promised to visit Jerusalem.  They had all promised to spend a year in the Peruvian rain forest witnessing to the natives, and six months in prison ministry, to try continence and Platte County Settlement Beer, the best in the area. Best to move the conversation to safe ground. Quickly there were murmurs and "Here, here!" from several.  More pitchers of beer appeared. There were more toasts, laughter, and the bishop told a story, listened to another which he roared at laughter at, and began another.  Matushka hoped it was not the one it seemed to be.\par
"God bless the United States Marine Corps!" one of the local elders returned the cheer, watching.  \par
"Hear, hear," the primary table echoed, the bishop wondering if he had perhaps spoken too much. So he joined in with vigor. It was perhaps his sixth full mug of the dark, potent Epper beer.  He put the empty mug down with a belch and smiled at Jake.\par
"Further," he continued in the same loud voice,"Although you certainly have the brains, you do not have the experience for this position.  I predict failure, as the problems you are faced with are deep and long lasting.  Nonetheless you have my full confidence and support. My full confidence.  I am sure you can do the job and the people in Michigan overrode my misgivings and objections, which remain.  I am confident you can, fully. Support.  I have your full, no you have my full support, my son. Continence is the way to go, and I am glad that you will never again have sex with your wife.  I have seen you wife. That would indeed be a difficult temptation because frankly my continence is tested every time I see her. Such a complexion. Such grace. Such...." Everyone started talking at once in an attempt to drown out his booming voice.  This was intolerable. \par
Betsy turned to Matushka, who was gathering her things but nodded at Betsy.\par
"That man can talk," said Matushka,"but I think our amanuensis is going to have to drive us home. If we don't leave soon, I fear, well, you will see." She attempted to catch the eye of the good bishop, who had started the sort of story that never ends well, especially in mixed company.  His booming voice had quieted the room and he indeed could tell a story.\par
"Dear," Matushka almost shouted, now standing, facing her husband on the other side of the next table over.  Everyone else was quiet, the teenage girls standing with their mothers, the mothers expressionlessly staring at the bishop.\par
"Yes, my dear," he said. He smiled indulgently, as if to say, \i see what I have to put up with\i0 . \par
"I am afraid we must leave now.  I am not feeling well."  That was the truth. No woman, least of all a bishop's wife, would have felt well then. She knew exactly where that story led. Luther and her husband would have competed in vulgarity.4\par
"Really, dear."\par
"Yes."  She pressed her hands against her stomach.  \par
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, pastors and elders, serving girls and the faithful, God bless the weakness of women. " He paused, and the \i amen \i0 was returned. "Remember the call and the glory of continence. I fear we must be going," and his party rose, one or two of them somewhat unsteadly, particularly since the chairs were so closely spaced to the other tables that it was indeed a wonder that the serving girls had managed to slip through, small though they were.  But where a slip of a girl can go, a three-hundred pound man who perhaps has reached his beer limit has trouble, and chairs and tables were scooted to let the party out.  Things were so close that  few managed to stand out of respect for the bishop, who also was having trouble standing. His wife had him firmly by the arm after elbowing a prominent pastor to the side, and she propelled the bishop out the door at a speed she could manage, the amanuensis at his other elbow.  She did not stop for umbrella or coat but drove on into the cold rain and found the car, bundled him into the back with the amanuensis, and found him singing "Heart of Oak" softly until he closed his eyes and began snoring. After pulling and pushing the bishop into a somewhat upright position, wife at his side, the amanuensis then exited into the rain and took the driver's seat.\par
Augustus Bishop Abernathy woke up at the sound of the car moving and wide-eyed, looked around.\par
"You are a fool," Matushka hissed at him in a whisper.\par
"There are reasons Catholic priests are celibate," he whispered back, eyes closed, head back.\par
"Such a man."\par
"Thank God for continence," he muttered back, and fell asleep. \par
