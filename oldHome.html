            <h2>USDA Ingredient Database</h2>
            <p>Look up ingredients on :<a href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb" target="_blank" \>the USDA nutritional site</a></p>
            <p>Ingredients vary and information concerning them is constantly changing.  Information should be used with caution. Using this tool intelligently requires that you become informed about nutrition.</p>
            "<p>What an individual should eat or does eat in a typical meal will of course vary with the individual.  There are many excellent tools available for computing this.  The present tool only helps in a general way.</p>
            <h2>Regarding Serving Sizes in General</h2>
            <p>Few people eat exactly one serving of anything,unless it is something like drinking one can of soda.  Bottle sizes vary, too, and someone may not finish a bottle, or may drink a bottle and a half. Efforts will be made to ease the computation of serving sizes as this thing develops. </p>
            <h2>Regarding NLEA servings:</h2>
            <h3>NLEA=Nutrition Labeling and Education Act </h3>
            <p>A serving size must be based on the amount of food we typically eat, not what we should eat. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>a serving size of fruit is usually 1 medium whole fruit or ½ cup cooked, canned or dried fruit</li>
                <li>a serving size of vegetables is usually one cup of raw or cooked leafy greens or ½ cup of higher calorie vegetables like carrots.</li>
                <li>a serving size of potatoes, pasta or grains is ½ cup or one slice of bread</li>
                <li>a serving of dairy is one cup of skim milk or yogurt or 1.5 ounces of cheese</li>
                <li>a serving size of meat, fish or poultry is about 3 ounces</li>
                <li> a serving size of oil or salad dressing is 2 teaspoons</li>
                <li>A serving size of alcohol depends on the drink that you choose.A serving of wine is 4 ounces, a serving of beer is 12 ounces and a serving of liquor is 1.5 ounces  </li>
            </ul>
